"Be My Bookie" is a way to bet on horse racing, hands-free and on the go!  

Try it out for yourself!  You will need to implement an Alexa Skill on your Amazon developer account so that you can use Alexa from your Amazon Echo/Alexa Reverb app.  Follow the instructions here:
https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit/alexa-skill-quick-start-tutorial, but replace the alexa-skills-kit-color-expert-python example with our horsebetmanager.py, then copy the ARN that is generated to associate with your built skill.  When you add a new skill, call it "Horse Bet Manager" -- and make your invocation "Be my bookie."

Once you have made your skill and have verified that it is running smoothly, you can explore "Be My Bookie."  Alexa opens with a welcome message.  Ask her, "Alexa, when is the next race?"  When she responds, follow up with "What are the horses running?" Listen carefully to the horses and the odds, and select your favorite runner.  Tell Alexa "I'm feeling lucky today!"  She will prompt you to make a bet.  Say "Put *amount* ether on horse *number* in race *number*".  Alexa will confirm that you want to blow this much cash on a wager (don't worry -- we are not on the ethereum network yet, so all this money is hypothetical!  Spend as much as you'd like and keep the farm too).  Confirm it!

Did you listen to the time of the race?  Once the race time is over, open up Be my Bookie and ask Alexa, "What are the results of race *number*?"  She will recite them to you.  Don't remember your horse?  Ask Alexa "Am I rolling on gold?" to find out what kind of profits (or lack thereof) you've added to your account.

The race card changes every day -- come back tomorrow for a chance to win all that precious Ether back!  

Thanks for playing with Alexa's "Be My Bookie" -- *making the world a bettor place*.
